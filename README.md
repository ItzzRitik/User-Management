# User Management

**User management** describes the ability for administrators to manage user access to various IT resources like systems, devices, applications, storage systems, networks and more. **User management** is a core part to any directory service and is a basic security essential for any organization. **User management** enables admins to control user access and **on-board** and **off-board** users to and from IT resources.
